# Pomodoro_timer
This is considered my 2nd small mini project. This project contains the tkinter library to practice my GUI skills

By default, the timer is set to:

- **Work session:** 25 minutes  
- **Short break:** 5 minutes  
- **Long break:** 20 minutes  

You can change these values in the code:

```python
WORK_MIN = 25
SHORT_BREAK_MIN = 5
LONG_BREAK_MIN = 20
